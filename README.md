# üìà STIN 2025 ‚Äì Burza Module

This repository contains the **Burza module** for the STIN 2025 semester project.
It is responsible for fetching, filtering, and managing stock data, as well as
interacting with an external News (Zpr√°vy) module to receive sentiment-based
stock ratings.

Developed with a responsive frontend and a modular NestJS backend, the system
supports scheduled data updates, user-defined filtering, and REST-based
integration.

## üß© Features

### üîÑ Data Management

- Scheduled and manual updates of historical stock data at `0:00`, `6:00`, `12:00`, `18:00`
- Retrieves current/historical prices for user-specified favorite tickers
- Persistent storage of user-defined preferences in a JSON file

### ‚≠ê Favorites

- REST API to update and retrieve favorite tickers (`/preferences`)
- Favorites are used as the base scope for all filters and ratings
- Fully responsive UI to manage favorites on desktop and mobile

### üîç Filtering

- `/search/filter/3d`: Filters tickers that dropped 3 consecutive business days
- `/search/filter/5d`: Filters tickers that dropped on more than 2 of the last 5 business days
- Filters always intersect results with user favorites

### üîó Integration with Zpr√°vy (News) Module

- `/search/ratings`: Calls the external News API to get ratings for tickers
- Ratings are integer values between `-10` and `10`
- Recommended stocks (rating > 5) are visually highlighted in the UI

### ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Highlights

- Developed in **TypeScript** using **NestJS** and **Vitest**
- > 80% **test coverage** (unit + e2e)
- **Dockerized** deployment using `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml`
- **CI/CD** with GitHub Actions (`check.yml`, `docker_build.yml`)
- **Externalized configuration** using `.env` and `ConfigService`
- Strict schema validation for API data (DTOs for rating, preferences, search)

## üìÅ JSON Data Format

Used for internal communication and rating payloads:

```json
[
	{ "name": "Microsoft", "date": 12345678, "rating": -10, "sell": 1 },
	{ "name": "Google", "date": 12345678, "rating": 10, "sell": 0 },
	{ "name": "OpenAI", "date": 12345678, "rating": 2, "sell": 0 }
]
```

- `rating`: range from `-10` (strongly negative) to `+10` (strongly positive)
- `sell`: 1 = sell recommended, 0 = hold/buy

## üñ• UI Features

- Desktop & mobile-friendly
- Filter tabs for 3d and 5d drop filters
- Star icons to manage favorites directly from search
